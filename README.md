# Hi there 👋 I'm Axil Jim 

## 🎓 About Me  
I’m a Information Technology student from Cabadbaran City, Philippines.  
I like to learn and build real-world programs — web apps, desktop utilities, or small projects — while studying.

- 💡 I enjoy coding in PHP, Java, Python, Dart/Flutter, and building web apps with MySQL / simple databases.  
- 🚀 I’m always learning new skills, improving old projects, and trying different programming languages and tools.

## 🛠️ What I Work On / What I Learned  

Here are some of my projects and experiments (school or side projects) 👇

- **Cake Ordering System (PHP + MySQL)** — a web app for ordering cakes: orders, CRUD (create/read/update/delete), automatic total calculation, and a simple UI.  
- **Number System Converter (Java)** — a console/desktop program that converts binary ↔ decimal ↔ octal ↔ hexadecimal using OOP, overloading/overriding, input validation.  
- **Simple e-commerce / prototype stores** — small experiments like a banana-chips/peanut-butter store or other mini-projects during learning.  
- **Other small utilities & practice code** — scripts or toy projects to learn syntax, logic, or new languages.

## 🎯 My Goals & What I Want to Learn  

- Improve my web-development skills (PHP + MySQL + HTML/CSS, maybe try JS or a framework later)  
- Get better at writing clean, maintainable code — even for small or school projects  
- Build more practical projects that can be used in real life (ordering systems, utilities, etc.)  
- Explore other languages and tools (Java, Python, Dart/Flutter) to widen my skills
